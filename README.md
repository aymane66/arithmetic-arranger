# Arithmetic Arranger

## Overview

The Arithmetic Arranger is a Python script that formats and displays arithmetic problems in a vertical arrangement. The script takes a list of arithmetic problems as input and outputs a neatly formatted display with aligned numbers and a horizontal line.

## Features

- **Supports Addition and Subtraction:** Handles both addition and subtraction operations for a variety of arithmetic problems.

- **Limit on Number Size:** Ensures that input numbers are limited to four digits, maintaining readability and preventing excessively large numbers.

- **Error Handling:** The script incorporates robust error handling, providing informative messages for issues such as too many problems, invalid operators, and non-digit characters in numbers.

- **Clear Output Format:** Generates an output with aligned numbers and a horizontal line for clarity and easy comprehension.
